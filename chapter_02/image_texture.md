# Blender image texture mapping, shading, and online 3D asset resources

## 1. Objective

This chapter discusses how to write Blender python script, to implement image texture mapping and shading, 
as well as the related online 3D asset resources.  

&nbsp;
## 2. Textbooks, video tutorials, and AI chatbots 

### 2.1 Textbooks

It seems that [the official Blender manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/index.html) is not well written, 
so that it is hard to use it as a textbook to learn Blender 3D tool. 

Many people complain that,

1. There is no good textbook on Blender.

2. Ever though there are quite some video tutorials on Blender on youtube.
   However, the learning curve is quite steep, especially to remember numerous hot-keys.  
   
For example, [batm4n on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/sxp8kp/comment/hxtrnpo/) said,

Sadly I get the impression that written material is quite a long way behind the curve compared to video tutorials.
You also have to bear in mind that many tutorials are not aimed at beginners. You need to be doing beginner specific tutorials at first.

Have you tried Grant Abitts Introduction tutorial?
He's very good for people that struggle to keep up with BlenderGuru.

You need to stop often and make notes - particularly of hotkeys.
I highly recommend repeating each tutorial from memory once you've finished.

### 2.2 Video tutorials

Our approach is to watch the tutorial videos. 

But instead of remembering the numerous details, 
only to understand Blender 3D tool's concepts and principles. 

The drawback of video tutorials is that it is not easy to search for the segments in a video on specific topics. 

Our solution is to make timestamps for the video. 

**https://tubestamp.com** is a website that can make video timestamps especially for Youtube. 

Comparing with the original timestamps of a sample youtube video, 
the tubestamp.com generated one is different in both the number of timestamps, and the title of each segment. 

However it might be sufficiently good for content search.

### 2.3 AI chatbots

An alternative to textbooks is to ask AI chatbots. 

Following are the two answers from two AI chatbots for the same question. 

The left one is **https://gemini.google.com/app**, the right one is **https://www.doubao.com/chat**. Both are free.
