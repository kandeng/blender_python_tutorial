# Blender python tutorial and AI coder

This is a series of Blender python tutorial, mainly focusing on the Blender functionality that targets at 3D virtual movie studio. 

There are two approaches to generate 3D objects and scenes. 

1. Use AI models to directly generate them with textual prompt.

2. Still using textual prompt as input, but we use use the prompt to write Blender python script, and execute the script to generate the 3D objects and scenes.

This series of tutorials takes the second approach, that is an indirect procedural generation. 

Instead of detailed explanating the usage of Blender python's APIs, this tutorial series focuses on the methodology. 

1. There is few articles teaching how to use Blender 3D tool, but there are quite some videos doing the job.

   We watch the video only to understand Blender 3D tool's concepts, principles and functionality in an intuitive way, but not remember all the details.

2. There is few articles and videos teaching how to use Blender python.

   We use AI chatbots to learn the concepts, principles and functionalites of Blender python, and use AI coder to write Blender python scripts and fix the bugs.

Here is the content table of the Blender python tutorials.

2. [Blender image texture mapping](./chapter_02/image_texture.md)
